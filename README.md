An analytics bot made to work mining Kripparian's (nl_kripp) chat.



### This is a BOT created with with _nodejs_ and the _twitch-js_ module to analyze the !bet system in nl_kripp's channel.

It only reads for each nickname the bets in the format "_!bet low|mid|high {number}_" and can provide statistics such as how many people voted, how many in each tier and the lettuce statistics.  
  
  
**It's by no means affiliated with Kripparian or his channel**; it's a **personal project** that I wanted because I'm a curious little one
And sorry, mods, if it was obnoxious enough to warrant a ban. Mah bad.
  
  
>Use _npm install_ with the package.json and it should work. Edit the **oath key, the channel and nickname** and voil√°.
  
(it also happens to have a _!watweather_ command with the _weather-js_ module, just for interesting fun)
  
    
    
#### PS: ALTHOUGH IT'S POSSIBLE FOR THE BOT TO SEND MESSAGES TO THE CHANNEL, I HAVE MANUALLY COMMENTED/REMOVED ALL LINES THAT WOULD DO SO, THEREFORE YOU'LL HAVE ACCESS TO THE ANALYTICS **IN YOUR CONSOLE ONLY** MEANING THAT **THE BOT WILL NEVER SEND MESSAGES TO KRIPP'S CHANNEL**
